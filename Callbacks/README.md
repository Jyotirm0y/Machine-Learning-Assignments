# Callbacks in Tensorflow-keras

In this project, I used predefined Callbacks as well as custom Callbacks.

A callback is a powerful tool to customize the behavior of a Keras model during training,
evaluation, or inference. 

Examples include `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` to visualize training progress and results with TensorBoard,
or `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` to periodically save your model during training.(Credit--Tensorflow)
